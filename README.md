# OpenLaringo

Introduction:

Videolaryngoscopy has revolutionized the approach of the airway(1). Its impact has reached the point of being considered the first device to be used in case of suspicion of VAD and even, today, many experts believe that this technology is called to definitely replace traditional laryngoscopy(2). Unfortunately, the high price of this technology makes impossible the massive use nowadays.
The realization of a low-cost video laryngoscope represents a challenge. 3D printing technology isn’t presented only for its low cost, but for its easy affordability, given the open nature of this technology as a good alternative for its manufacture.

Material and methods: 

This videolaringoscope is designed and built with 3D printing technology with PLA plastic. This model was delivered to all residents of Anesthesiology University Hospital of “Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria” (n: 14) and they were asked to perform a phantom orotracheal intubation to verify its usefulness and their experience was evaluated through a survey.

Results:

100% of the residents managed to perform orotracheal intubation in phantom. All residents considered the use of the device as easy (85%) or very easy (15%)

Conclusions:

In total, 84 versions have been necessary to achieve the current model. Although there are other models of video laryngoscope made with 3D printing(3), the differentiating characteristics of the latter, such as low cost (€ 1.5), a modularity that allows future customization and the use of non-toxic materials, make this model a promising alternative to use in patients and a promising candidate to become the answer for the massive use of this technology, not only by anesthetists.
